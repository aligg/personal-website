        <h1>Hi, I'm Ali Glenesk&#128075;</h1>
        <p>I'm a senior software engineer and seasoned operations leader passionate about full-stack product engineering, internal tools, doing right by people, and working at the intersections of policy, technology, and social good.</p>
        <p>I'm experienced with React, Python, Flask, JavaScript, SQL and pushing for the best solution even when it is a non-tech one.</p>
        <p>My super powers are shipping code and helping you ship your code (team bias to action here&#128587;&#127996;&#8205;&#9792;&#65039;), speaking up and pushing back (let's navigate trade-offs to get things done together&#128200;), and organization strategy (bringing subject matter and people expertise to what we're trying to achieve together&#129309;&#127996;). Mentoring, collaboration, and coffee energize me.&#9749;</p>
        <h2>Work</h2>
        Currently I am an enginer at <a href="https://www.navapbc.com/" target="_blank">Nava PBC</a> building applications and tools to enable broader and better access to government services.
