        <h1>Hi, I'm Ali Glenesk&#128075;</h1>
        <p>I'm a senior software engineer and seasoned operations leader passionate about full-stack product engineering, internal tools, doing right by people, and working at the intersections of policy, technology, and social good.</p>
        <p>I'm experienced with React, Python, Flask, JavaScript, SQL and pushing for the best solution even when it is a non-tech one.</p>
        <p>My super powers are shipping code and helping you ship your code (team bias to action here&#128587;&#127996;&#8205;&#9792;&#65039;), speaking up and pushing back (let's navigate trade-offs to get things done together&#128200;), and organization strategy (bringing subject-matter and people expertise to what we're trying to achieve together&#129309;&#127996;). Mentoring, collaboration, and coffee energize me.&#9749;</p>
        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>Currently I'm a software engineer at <a href="https://www.navapbc.com/" target="_blank">Nava PBC</a> building applications and tools to enable broader and better access to government services. The mission and scale of Nava's work really resonate with me.</p>
        <p>Previously I was a product engineer at <a href="https://www.curaihealth.com/" target="_blank">Curai Health</a> building a virtual primary care application. I love the grind and camaraderie of start-ups and my peers at Curai were best in class.</p>
        <p>Prior to becoming an engineer, I led policy and operations teams at YouTube, specializing in data analytics and content moderation for violence, child abuse, and extremism. I'll carry in my heart deep appreciation for Trust & Safety work and the people who do it throughout my life. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lifes-living-ka-tsai-ku/" target="_blank">This article</a> by Ka Tsai K sums up a lot for me. </p>
        <p>I don't <i>complete</i> a lot of coding projects outside of work, but I do have a lot of learning in public on <a href="https://github.com/aligg" target="_blank">github</a>. For more about my professional life, see my <a href="alig-resume-last-updated-august-2022.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
