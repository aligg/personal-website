    <h1>Hi, I'm Ali Glenesk&#128075;</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a senior software engineer and seasoned operations leader passionate
      about full-stack product engineering, internal tools, doing right by
      people, and working at the intersections of policy, technology, and social
      good.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm experienced with React, Python, Flask, JavaScript, SQL and pushing for
      the best solution even when it is a non-tech one.
    </p>
    <p>
      My super powers are shipping code and helping you ship your code (team
      bias to action here&#128587;&#127996;&#8205;&#9792;&#65039;), speaking up
      and pushing back (let's navigate trade-offs to get things done
      together&#128200;), and organization strategy (bringing subject-matter and
      people expertise to what we're trying to achieve
      together&#129309;&#127996;). Mentoring, collaboration, and coffee energize
      me.&#9749;
    </p>
    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>
      Currently I'm a software engineer at
      <a href="https://www.navapbc.com/" target="_blank">Nava PBC</a> building
      applications and tools to enable broader and better access to government
      services. The mission and scale of Nava's work really resonate with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previously I was a product engineer at
      <a href="https://www.curaihealth.com/" target="_blank">Curai Health</a>
      building a virtual primary care application. I love the grind and
      camaraderie of start-ups and my peers at Curai were best in class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to becoming an engineer, I led policy and operations teams at
      YouTube, specializing in data analytics and content moderation for
      violence, child abuse, and extremism. I'll carry in my heart deep
      appreciation for Trust & Safety work and the people who do it throughout
      my life.

    </p>
    <p>
      I don't <i>complete</i> a lot of coding projects outside of work, but I do
      have a lot of learning in public on
      <a href="https://github.com/aligg" target="_blank">github</a>. For more
