    <h1>Hi, I'm Ali Glenesk&#128075;</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a senior software engineer and seasoned operations leader passionate
      about full-stack product engineering, internal tools, doing right by
      people, and working at the intersections of policy, technology, and social
      good.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm experienced with React, Python, Flask, JavaScript, SQL and pushing for
      the best solution even when it is a non-tech one.
    </p>
    <p>
      My super powers are shipping code and helping you ship your code (team
      bias to action here&#128587;&#127996;&#8205;&#9792;&#65039;), speaking up
      and pushing back (let's navigate trade-offs to get things done
      together&#128200;), and organization strategy (bringing subject-matter and
      people expertise to what we're trying to achieve
      together&#129309;&#127996;). Mentoring, collaboration, and coffee energize
      me.&#9749;
    </p>
    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>
      Currently I'm a software engineer at
      <a href="https://www.navapbc.com/" target="_blank">Nava PBC</a> building
      applications and tools to enable broader and better access to government
      services. The mission and scale of Nava's work really resonate with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previously I was a product engineer at
      <a href="https://www.curaihealth.com/" target="_blank">Curai Health</a>
      building a virtual primary care application. I love the grind and
      camaraderie of start-ups and my peers at Curai were best in class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to becoming an engineer, I led policy and operations teams at
      YouTube, specializing in data analytics and content moderation for
      violence, child abuse, and extremism. I'll carry in my heart deep
      appreciation for Trust & Safety work and the people who do it throughout
      my career.

    </p>
    <p>
      I don't <i>complete</i> a lot of coding projects outside of work, but I do
      have a lot of learning in public on
      <a href="https://github.com/aligg" target="_blank">github</a>. For more

        “To love. To be loved. To never forget your own insignificance. To never
        get used to the unspeakable violence and the vulgar disparity of life
        around you. To seek joy in the saddest places. To pursue beauty to its
        lair. To never simplify what is complicated or complicate what is
        simple. To respect strength, never power. Above all, to watch. To try
        and understand. To never look away. And never, never to forget.
